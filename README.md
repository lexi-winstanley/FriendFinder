# FriendFinder

## Description
Friend Finder is a web application deployed with Heroku. Users answer survey questions and are then based on their answers are shown their best stored friend match.

## Organization
This application is organized into an app directory which is subdivided into data, public and routing folders. The data folder holds the stored friends data as an array of objects, the public folder holds the HTML and images while the routing folder holds files defining the API and HTML routes. A server file initializes the server and brings together the other resources as necessary to enable the application's functionality.

## Instructions
The user is first brought to a landing page that has a button linking them to the survey page where they will be asked to answer a few questions. Once they submit the form, their answers are captured and compared with stored friends' data. The stored friend with the lowest absolute difference from the scores will be returned as the user's best possible friend match.
